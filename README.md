#💀 Xploit AI: AI-Powered Web Pentest Assistant


#🔐 Project Vision
"Xploit AI" aims to revolutionize web penetration testing by integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate the detection of common web vulnerabilities. The goal is to create an intelligent assistant that not only identifies security flaws but also guides security professionals through the testing process, offering real-time insights and actionable remediation advice. This tool will significantly reduce the manual effort and expertise required for initial vulnerability assessments, allowing pentesters to focus on more complex, nuanced threats.

#❗ Problem Statement
Traditional web penetration testing is often a manual, time-consuming, and expertise-intensive process. Identifying vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, and CSRF across large web applications can be prone to human error and inefficiency. Existing automated scanners, while useful, often lack the contextual understanding and adaptive capabilities that an experienced human pentester possesses.

#✨ Solution: Xploit AI's Approach
Xploit AI addresses these challenges by combining the power of established security tools with advanced AI/ML models. It provides a user-friendly chat interface, making the complex process of vulnerability scanning more accessible and interactive.

#🚀 Key Features
AI/ML-Powered Vulnerability Detection:

Integrates AI/ML models (e.g., leveraging large language models like Gemini-2.0-Flash or fine-tuned models) to analyze web traffic, application behavior, and source code patterns.

OWASP Top 10 Focus: Specifically trained to identify and flag vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Broken Access Control, Security Misconfigurations, and more.

Interactive Chat Interface:

A conversational AI assistant (like "ChatGPT for Pentesters") that guides the user through the pentesting process.

Users can ask questions about findings, request deeper analysis, or get explanations for specific vulnerabilities.

Provides context-aware suggestions and next steps based on the current scan results.

Automated Scanning and Reporting:

Ability to initiate scans on target websites (with explicit permission from the website owner).

Generates comprehensive, human-readable reports detailing identified vulnerabilities.

Reports include: Vulnerability name, description, affected URLs/parameters, Proof-of-Concept (PoC) examples, severity level, and detailed remediation suggestions.

CVSS Scoring and Risk Prioritization:

Automatically calculates a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score for each identified vulnerability.

Prioritizes vulnerabilities based on their CVSS score and potential impact, helping users focus on the most critical issues first.

Integration with Industry-Standard Tools:

Nmap Integration: For network discovery, port scanning, and service version detection.

sqlmap Integration: Leveraging sqlmap's powerful SQL injection detection and exploitation capabilities.

GitHub Actions for CI: Ensuring code quality, automated testing, and streamlined deployment.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask)

AI/ML: OpenAI/GPT (or other LLMs like Gemini-2.0-Flash via API)

Security Tools Integration: Nmap, sqlmap

Database (Optional): SQLite (for local storage of scan history, reports)

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript

CI/CD: GitHub Actions

#🐧 Getting Started on Linux
Follow these steps to set up and run Xploit AI on your Linux machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

git

Nmap: Install via your package manager (e.g., sudo apt install nmap on Debian/Ubuntu, sudo dnf install nmap on Fedora/RHEL).

sqlmap: Install via your package manager (e.g., sudo apt install sqlmap on Debian/Ubuntu, sudo dnf install sqlmap on Fedora/RHEL).

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/XploitAI/AI-Powered-Web-Pentest-Assistant.git
cd AI-Powered-Web-Pentest-Assistant

Create and activate a virtual environment:
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Environment Variables:
If you are using an AI API (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI), you must set your API key as an environment variable. Never hardcode API keys in your code.

export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
# Or for OpenAI:
# export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"

For persistent environment variables, add the export line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file and then run source ~/.bashrc (or source ~/.zshrc).

Running the Application
Once everything is set up, you can run the Flask application:

python main.py

The application will typically start on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Open this URL in your web browser to access the Xploit AI chat interface.

When you run main.py, you'll see the custom "Xploit AI" skull design in your terminal:
